# YouTube image downloader

Hello,

I'm a little Node.js app that downloads poster images from YouTube playlist items.


## Setup

Getting up and running is easy:

* Run `npm install`


## Configuration

Edit the config file in your `data` directory.

* api_key: Your YouTube Data V3 API Key. It is recommended you register your own key and use it instead of the default key.
* image_output: The directory where you would like your images to be saved
* playlists: An array of Youtube playlist ids


## Running the app

Run `node youtube-image-downloader.js` and watch the magic happen :)
